## Weather-App-radio
This project is combination of few must-have(at least for me, in daily routine) perks like, weather-app, radio and  clock.

## Motivation
I came up with an idea to make something similar to the desktop, which contain all features like weather-app, radio and clock. Thanks to that,
I don't need to check every single information on diffrent device. While I am doing something else then coding, I can still see what is going on and
listening to the great music!

## Build status
This page is still in building process.
I am consider to add more futures like: news, daily duty etc. 
I have to fix wave-animation (to make it much more smooth).

## Code style
I didn't make code review for this one, so there is possibility for a little chaos in my code. //for now

## Tech/framework used
HTML, CSS, JS.

## Special thanks to: 
Edd dev - his weather-app turtorial was an inspiration for me to do this project.
