## LIVE CODE: https://282621.github.io/weather-App-radio/

## Weather-App-radio
This project is a combination of a few must-have(at least for me, in daily routine) perks like weather-app, radio, and clock.

## Motivation
I came up with an idea to make something similar to the desktop, which contains all features like weather-app, radio, and clock. Thanks to that,
I don't need to check every single information on the diffrent devices. While I am doing something else then coding, I can still see what is going on and
listening to the great music!

## Build status
This page is still in the building process.
I consider adding more futures like news, daily duty, etc. 
I have to fix wave-animation (to make it much more smooth).
Considering making this app for the mobile version.

## Code style
I didn't make a code review for this one, so there is a possibility for a little chaos in my code. //for now

## Tech/framework used
HTML, CSS, JS.
